Hello. I am **Mozhar Alhosni**. Welcome to my Digital Garden, in where I share the knowledge I harvest everyday. I built this digital garden using `Blazor SSR` and [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/).

I am an Offensive Cybersecurity Specialist. My passion is programming (been doing it for over 10 years) and web development and security. I specialize in `ASP.NET`, with a focus on `Web APIs` and `Blazor` web apps (`.NET 7` and `.NET 8`).

In the future, I aspire to be the most knowledgeable person in SPAs (especially Blazor Web Apps) and WASM Security. I am planning to pursue my Master's in Computer Science this year, with a thesis titled `Web Vulnerabilities in SPA Frameworks, specifically focusing on Blazor`, or, `WASM Security: A Comprehensive Study`. I personally believe that SPAs and WASM are the future.

As a side-hobby, I keep up with Darknet (run over `Tor`) Marketplaces; I still remember the day `Dread Pirate Roberts` was caught, thinking, if the king got caught, so shall the pawns fall. My Bachelor's graduation project was titled "Decentralized Marketplace using Blockchain with a Native Cryptocurrency", for which I built a Digital Decentralized Marketplace using [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/), [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), and [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) (for decentralized storage access via [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)).

As a Muslim, I am also interested in Islamic Sciences and Theology in general.
