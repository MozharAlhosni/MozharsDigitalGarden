# Similarity Between Words and Sentences

- For `LLMs`, it is crucial to known when two `words` or `sentences` are _similar_ or _different_. `Word embeddings` are helpful for this task.

# Similarity between text

- Determining whether two `words` are _similar_ or _different_ is a very important task for every `LLM`. An even harder problem is determining whether two different sentences are _similar_ to _different_. `Word` and `sentence` `embeddings` are very useful for this task.
- Two important types of `similarities` are the `dot product` `similarity` and `cosine` `similarity`.

## Dot Product Similarity

- Uses dot product on embeddings to determine similarity.
- Suppose you have the below embeddings of 4 movies, with the first coordinate specifies the `Action` genre while second specifies the `Comedy`:
	- "You've Got Mail": \[0,5\]
	- "Rush Hour": \[6,5\]
	- "Rush Hour 2": \[7,4\]
	- "Taken": \[7,0\]
- To calculate the similarity using `dot product`:
	- \["You've Got Mail", "Taken"\] = 0\*7+5\*0 = 0
	- \["Rush Hour", "Rush Hour 2"\] = 6\*7+5\*4 = 62
- Thus, "You've Got Mail" and "Taken" are _not similar_, while "Rush Hour" and "Rush Hour 2" are _similar_.

## Cosine Similarity

- Another measure of `similarity` between `sentences` (and `words`) is the `angle` between them.
- The `cosine` of `angles` close to zero is close to 1, and as the `angle` grows, the `cosine` decreases.
- The `cosine` distance is the `cosine` of the `angle` formed by `two rays` going from the `origin` of the plane to the two sentences.
