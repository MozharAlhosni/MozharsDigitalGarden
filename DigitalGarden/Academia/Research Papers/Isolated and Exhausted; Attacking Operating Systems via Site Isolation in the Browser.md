# Thoughts

The research paper is of excellent quality. They explain how to bypass mitigations put forward by Site Isolation, a defensive mechanism that Web browsers implement. FireFox, as always, was the only browser to prevent the attacks experimented by the researchers. Additionally, their `Site Isolation` implementation is known as [Project Fission](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission).
