# Thoughts

The research paper gives a gentle introduction to attacks against CI/CI pipelines, providing a systematic study. They also developed a tool https://github.com/ZJU-SEC/CIAnalyser.

# Problems

The research paper has flaws, including:

- Few typos. The tool they created is called "CIAnalyser", which is British English. However, throughout the paper, they use "analyze", which is American English...
- Extreme repetitions of certain phrases
- Not concise
- The "Related Work" section goes off on a tangent
